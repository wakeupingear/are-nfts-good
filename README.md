NFTs are the future. They are also apeshit and doomed to fail. Confused? Well, AreNFTsGood? is here to help! Using advanced algorthmic strategies, this website mathematically computes a rolling average of virally networked concensus data, dynamically weighing anonymous, decentralized feedback to compute the Internet's current opinion about whether a picture of a monkey is worth 1.6204 million dollars.

## How it works
Twitter bot posts 24h poll --> Server compares votes --> ??? --> Website works

Please don't take this as an endorsement of crypto or NFTs. I ride clicks, not rockets.
